I started with Salt on Linux first, so I already
had my Salt master all set up on my server 'plankton'.

In the Windows installation, in the search bar
in the bottom left search for WordPad and then
right click on it and select "Run as Administrator".  Click
OK or Yes when prompted.  In WordPad use File->Open and then select
C:\Windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts
open it and add a line
192.168.1.11  plankton
(replace 192.168.1.11 with the IP address of your Salt master server
and plankton with your Salt master hostname).
then save and exit.

Download the latest Salt package for Windows from
https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/installation/windows.html
and install it, entering the Salt master hostname and the Windows machine
hostname in the appropriate input box.

In the Windows search bar search for PowerShell and then right
click and select "Run as Administrator".  Click OK or Yes when
prompted.  Then type or paste into the PowerShell prompt
Get-Service | Where-Object {$_.name -eq "salt-minion"}
and press enter.  You should get Status value "Running".
From there, the Salt master should be able to add the minion.
sudo salt-key -A
